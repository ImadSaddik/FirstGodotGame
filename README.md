# My first Godot game

I finally decided to try out Godot. This game builds on what the amazing [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys/videos) started in this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&t). I improved the game by adding menus, more levels, the ability to hit enemies with a sword, a shield, double jumps, particle effects, and more.

I was surprised by how light and easy-to-use the Godot engine is. I also liked coding in GDScript because itâ€™s similar to Python.

Overall, I had a lot of fun working on this project!
