# My first Godot game

![Pixel Enemy Slayer](/banner.svg)

I finally decided to try out Godot. This game builds on what the amazing [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys/videos) started in this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&t). I improved the game by adding menus, more levels, the ability to hit enemies with a sword, a shield, double jumps, particle effects, and more.

I was surprised by how light and easy-to-use the Godot engine is. I also liked coding in GDScript because itâ€™s similar to Python.

Overall, I had a lot of fun working on this project! Here are some of the things that I added to the original game.

## Menus

I have added menus to the game. The start menu appears after launching the game.

Clicking on the start game button moves to the other menu that allows the users to select a level they want to play

The controls button shows the actions that the player can perform in the game

Clicking on the settings button shows the settings menu where users can control the sound level of the game and sound effects.

Finally, when clicking on the exit button, the game closes.

When starting to play a level, you will notice that I added in game UI. It shows the amount of coins that you collected, the shield icon, and the pause button

When hovering on the shield icon, a tooltip will be displayed with some information about the shield ability.

Clicking on the pause button shows the pause menu. It allows you to quit the level if you want.

If you die in the game, the game over menu is shown

Finally, if you win, the win menu is displayed. It allows you to advance to the next level or go back to the main menu.

## Slime flavours

I have created many flavours of the cute slime monster, ice, hell, and regular.

## Slime balls

Slimes can shoot slime balls on the player.

## Jumping

I have allowed the player to double jump instead of just performing one single jump. I have also added a jumping effect that plays whenever the player jumps.

## Sword

Since I have given slimes a weapon, I thought why not give the player a sword.

When a slime is hit by the sword it explodes

## Shield

This is a special ability that the player can use, it allows them to be safe for 5 seconds. Since this ability is very powerful, I decided to make it usable only once.

## Inverted gravity

In the third level, I decided to invert the gravity at some point.

## Ladder climbing

In the presence of a ladder, the player can use up and down arrow keys to interact with the ladder.
